- Halo people , this is a new personal project I am working on.

- In this README.md , I will show you what is bootstrap and how to insert it in your html file!

*WHAT IS BOOTSTRAP?:*


Bootstrap is a popular framework used in web development to make building websites easier and faster. It provides a set of pre-designed and pre-coded components, like buttons, forms, and navigation bars, that you can use to create a website without starting from scratch. Bootstrap 5 is the latest version of this framework. It comes with updated features, improvements, and new tools for web developers. It helps them create responsive and visually appealing websites that work well on different devices, like computers, tablets, and smartphones. In simpler terms, Bootstrap 5 is like a toolbox for web developers. It gives them ready-to-use tools so they don't have to create everything from the beginning, making the process of building websites more efficient and saving time.

*HOW TO INSERT BOOTSTRAP IN HTML :*

- First and foremost , locate your way to this webpage on your browser ( or click here : https://getbootstrap.com/ )

*EXTRA NOTE:*

- You can refer to this website if you need a little mini inspiration on your web components ( animation , navbar , scrolling etc. ): https://bbbootstrap.com/
- Bootstrap is a css framework , with a purpose to speed up the web dev process. However , there are some instances where you will still have to code in a pure css file.
- Do not hesitate to watch some references on the internet ( YouTube , StackOverflow etc. ) as some functions in Bootstrap are quite new and interesting!

Good Luck and Happy Coding :D
