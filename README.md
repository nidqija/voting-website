*WHAT IS BOOTSTRAP?:*


Bootstrap is a popular framework used in web development to make building websites easier and faster. It provides a set of pre-designed and pre-coded components, like buttons, forms, and navigation bars, that you can use to create a website without starting from scratch. Bootstrap 5 is the latest version of this framework. It comes with updated features, improvements, and new tools for web developers. It helps them create responsive and visually appealing websites that work well on different devices, like computers, tablets, and smartphones. In simpler terms, Bootstrap 5 is like a toolbox for web developers. It gives them ready-to-use tools so they don't have to create everything from the beginning, making the process of building websites more efficient and saving time.
